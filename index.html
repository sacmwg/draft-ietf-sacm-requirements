  <h1 id="rfc.section.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">Today's environment of rapidly-evolving security threats highlights the need to automate the sharing of such information while protecting user information as well as the systems that store, process, and transmit this information.  Security threats can be detected in a number of ways. SACM's charter focuses on how to collect and share this information based on use cases that involve posture assessment of endpoints.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">Scalable and sustainable collection, expression, and evaluation of endpoint information is foundational to SACM's objectives.  To secure and defend a network, one must reliably determine what devices are on the network, how those devices are configured from a hardware perspective, what software products are installed on those devices, and how those products are configured.  We need to be able to determine, share, and use this information in a secure, timely, consistent, and automated manner to perform endpoint posture assessments.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">This document focuses on describing the requirements for facilitating the exchange of posture assessment information in the enterprise, in particular, for the use cases as exemplified in <a href="#I-D.ietf-sacm-use-cases">[I-D.ietf-sacm-use-cases]</a>. Also, this document uses terminology defined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology">[I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology]</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> Requirements Language</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="#RFC2119">RFC 2119</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC2119]</cite>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.2">When the words appear in lower case, their natural language meaning is used.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#reqmts" id="reqmts">Requirements</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">This document defines requirements based on the SACM use cases defined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-sacm-use-cases">[I-D.ietf-sacm-use-cases]</a>.  This section describes the requirements used by SACM to assess and compare candidate data models, interfaces, and protocols, to suit the SACM architecture.  These requirements express characteristics or features that a candidate protocol or data model must be capable of offering to ensure security and interoperability.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">Multiple data models, protocols, and transports may be employed in a SACM environment. A SACM transport protocol is one that runs on top of L3 protocols such as TCP/IP or L4 protocols such as HTTP, carries operations (requests / responses), and moves data. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">SACM defines an architecture and information model focused on addressing the needs for determining, sharing, and using posture information via Posture Information Providers and Posture Information Consumers mediated by a Controller.  With the information model defining assets and attributes to facilitate the guidance, collection, and assessment of posture, these are some of the tasks that should be considered: </p>
<p/>

<ol>
  <li>Asset Classification: Map the assets on the target endpoints to asset classes.  This enables identification of the attributes needed to exchange information pertaining to the target endpoint. </li>
  <li>Attribute Definition: Define the attributes desired to be collected from each target endpoint.  This is what we want to know about a target endpoint. For instance, organizations will want to know what software is installed and its many critical security attributes such as patch level. </li>
  <li>Policy Definition: This is where an organization can express its policy for acceptable or problematic values of an endpoint attribute. The expected values of an endpoint attribute are determined for later comparison against the actual endpoint attribute values during the evaluation process. Expected values may include both those values which are good as well as those values which represent problems, such as vulnerabilities. The organization can also specify the endpoint attributes that are to be present for a given target endpoint.</li>
  <li>Information Collection: Collect information (attribute values) from the target endpoint to populate the endpoint data.</li>
  <li>Endpoint Assessment: Evaluate the actual values of the endpoint attributes against those expressed in the policy. (An evaluation result may become additional endpoint data).</li>
  <li>Result Reporting: Report the results of the evaluation for use by other components. Examples of use of a report would be additional evaluation, network enforcement, vulnerability detection, and license management.</li>
</ol>

<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.1">Many deployment scenarios can be instantiated to address the above tasks and use cases defined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-sacm-use-cases">[I-D.ietf-sacm-use-cases]</a>. To ensure interoperability, scalability, and flexibility in any of these deployments, the following requirements are defined for proposed SACM standards:</p>

  <dd style="margin-left: 1">Topology Flexibility: Both centralized and decentralized (peer-to-peer) information exchange MUST be supported.  Centralized data exchange enables use of a common data format to bridge together data exchange between diverse systems, and can leverage a virtual data store that centralizes and offloads all data access, storage, and maintenance to a dedicated resource. Decentralized data exchange enables simplicity of sharing data between relatively uniform systems, and between small numbers of systems, especially within a single enterprise domain.

  <dd style="margin-left: 1">Extensible Attribute Vocabulary: The information model MUST define a minimum set of attributes for communicating Posture Information, to ensure interoperability between data models. (Individual data models may define attributes beyond the mandatory-to-implement minimum set.) The attributes should be defined with a clear mechanism for extensibility to enable data models to adhere to SACM's required attributes as well as allow for their own extensions. The attribute vocabulary should be defined with a clear mechanism for extensibility to enable future versions of the information model to be interoperably expanded with new attributes.</dd>
  <dt>IM-002</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 1">Posture Data Publication: The information model MUST allow for the data to be provided by a SACM component either solicited or unsolicited.

  <dt>DM-002</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 1">Data Model Structure: The data model can be structured either as one single module or separated into modules and sub-modules that allow for references between them. The data model structure MAY reflect structure in the information model, but does not need to. For example, the data model might use one module to define endpoints, and that module might reference other modules that describe the various assets associated with the endpoint. Constraints and interfaces might further be defined to resolve or tolerate ambiguity in the references (e.g. same IP address used in two separate networks).</dd>
  <dt>DM-003</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 1">Search Flexibility: The search interfaces and actions MUST include the ability to start a search anywhere within a data model structure, and the ability to search based on patterns ("wildcard searches") as well as specific data elements.</dd>
  <dt>DM-004</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 1">Full vs. Partial Updates: The data model SHOULD include the ability to allow providers of data to provide the data as a whole, or when updates occur.  For example, a consumer can request a full update on initial engagement, then request to receive deltas (updates containing only the changes since the last update) on an ongoing basis as new data is generated. </dd>
  <dt>DM-005</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 1">Loose Coupling: The data model SHOULD allow for a loose coupling between the provider and the consumer, such that the consumer can request information without being required to request it from a specific provider, and a provider can publish information without having a specific consumer targeted to receive it.</dd>
  <dt>DM-006</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 1">Data Cardinality: The data model MUST describe their constraints (e.g. cardinality). As posture information and the tasks for collection, aggregation, or evaluation, could comprise one or more attributes, interfaces and actions MUST allow and account for such cardinality as well as whether the attributes are conditional, optional, or mandatory.</dd>
  <dt>DM-007</dt>

  <dt>DM-014</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 1">Attribute Extensibility: Use Cases in the whole of Section 2 describe the need for an attribute dictionary. With SACM's scope focused on posture assessment, the data model attribute collection and aggregation MUST have a well-understood set of attributes inclusive of their meaning or usage intent. The data model MUST include all attributes defined in the information model and MAY include additional attributes beyond those found in the information model. Additional attributes MUST be defined in accordance with the extensibility framework provided in the information model.</dd>
  <dt>DM-015</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 1">Solicited vs. Unsolicited Updates: The data model MUST enable a provider to publish data either solicited (in response to a request from a consumer) or unsolicited (as new data is generated, without a request required). For example, an external collector can publish data in response to a request by a consumer for information about an endpoint, or can publish data as it observes new information about an endpoint, without any specific consumer request triggering the publication; a compliance-server provider may publish endpoint posture information in response to a request from a consumer (solicited), or it may publish posture information driven by a change in the posture of the endpoint (unsolicited).</dd>

A method for detecting and reporting time discrepancies SHOULD be provided.</dd>
  <dt>OP-002</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 1">Collection Abstraction: Collection is the act of a SACM component gathering data from a target endpoint. The request for a data item MUST include enough information to properly identify the item to collect, but the request shall not be a command to directly execute nor directly be applied as arguments to a command. The purpose of this requirement is primarily to reduce the potential attack vectors, but has the additional benefit of abstracting the request for collection from the collection method, thereby allowing more flexibility in how collection is implemented.</dd>
  <dt>OP-003</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 1">Collection Composition: A collection request MAY be composed of multiple collection requests (which yield collected values). The desire for multiple values MUST be expressed as part of the collection request, so that the aggregation can be resolved at the point of collection without having to interact with the requestor. This requirement SHOULD NOT be interpreted as preventing a collector from providing attributes which were not part of the original request. </dd>

  <dd style="margin-left: 1">Attribute-based Query: A query operation is the act of requesting data from a provider. Query operations SHOULD be based on a set of attributes. Query operations MUST support both a query for specific attributes and a query for all attributes.

  <dt>OP-005</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 1">Information-based Query with Filtering: The query operation MUST support filtering. Use Case 2.1.3 describes the need for the data model to support the means for the information to be collected through a query mechanism. Furthermore, the query operation requires filtering capabilities to allow for only a subset of information to be retrieved. The query operation MAY be a synchronous request or asynchronous request.</dd>
  <dt>OP-006</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 1">Data Model Scalability: The operation resulting from a query operation MUST be able to handle the return and receipt of large amounts of data. Use Cases 2.1.4 and 2.1.5 describes the need for the data model to support scalability. For example, the query operation may result in a very large set of attributes, as well as a large set of targets.</dd>
  <dt>OP-007</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 1">Data Abstraction: The data model MUST allow a SACM component to communicate what data was used to construct the target endpoint's identity, so other SACM components can determine whether they are constructing an equivalent target endpoint (and their identity) and whether they have confidence in that identity. SACM components SHOULD have interfaces defined to transmit this data directly or to refer to where the information can be retrieved.</dd>

For example, a proxy server between UDP and TCP can provide a connection that correctly fulfills the connectivity and replay requirements as well as data link requirements (through the use of TLS and DTLS) but would be unable to provide a channel binding requirement, as that implies there is no MITM to look at the data.</dd>

<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">This document defines the requirements for SACM.  As such, it is expected that several data models, protocols, and transports may be defined or reused from already existing standards.  This section will highlight security considerations that may apply to SACM based on the architecture and standards applied in SACM. In particular, highlights to security considerations that may apply to the SACM reference architecture and standard data models and transports will be discussed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">To address security and privacy considerations, the data model, protocols, and transports must consider authorization based on consumer function and privileges, to only allow authorized consumers and providers to access specific information being requested or published.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.3">To enable federation across multiple entities (such as across organizational or geographic boundaries) authorization must also extend to infrastructure elements themselves, such as central controllers / brokers / data repositories.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.4">In addition, authorization needs to extend to specific information or resources available in the environment. In other words, authorization is based on the subject (the information requestor), the provider (the information responder), the object (the endpoint the information is being requested on), and the attribute (what piece of data is being requested). The method by which this authorization is applied is unspecified.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.5">SACM's charter focuses on the sharing of posture information for improving efficacy of security applications such as compliance, configuration, assurance and other threat and vulnerability reporting and remediation systems.  While the goal is to facilitate the flow of information securely, it is important to note that participating endpoints may not be cooperative or trustworthy.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.1"><a href="#rfc.section.5.1">5.1.</a> <a href="#Trust" id="Trust">Trust between Provider and Requestor</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.1">The information given from the provider to a requestor may come with different levels of trustworthiness given the different potential deployment scenarios and compromise either at the provider, the requesting consumer, or devices that are involved in the transport between the provider and requestor.  This section will describe the different considerations that may reduce the level of trustworthiness of the information provided.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">In the information transport flow, it is possible that some of the devices may serve as proxies or brokers and as such, may be able to observe the communications flowing between an information provider and requestor. Without appropriate protections, it is possible for these proxies and brokers to inject and affect man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.3">It is common to, in general, distrust the network service provider, unless the full hop by hop communications process flow is well understood.  As such, the posture information provider should protect the posture information data it provides as well as the transport it uses. Similarly, while there may be providers whose goal is to openly share its information, there may also be providers whose policy is to grant access to certain posture information based on its business or regulatory policy.  In those situations, a provider may require full authentication and authorization of the requestor (or set of requestors) and share only the authorized information to the authenticated and authorized requestors.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.4">A requestor beyond distrusting the network service provider, must also account that the information received from the provider may have been communicated through an undetermined network communications system.  That is, the posture information may have traversed through many devices before reaching the requestor.  SACM specifications should provide the means for verifying data origin and data integrity and at minimum, provide endpoint authentication and transport integrity.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.5">A requestor may require data freshness indications, both knowledge of data origination as well as time of publication so that it can make more informed decisions about the relevance of the data based on its currency and/or age. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.6">It is also important to note that endpoint assessment reports, especially as they may be provided by the target endpoint may pose untrustworthy information.  The considerations for this is described in Section 8 of <a href="#RFC5209">[RFC5209]</a>. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.7">The trustworthiness of the posture information given by the provider to one or many requestors is dependent on several considerations.  Some of these include the requestor requiring: </p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.1">SACM information may contain sensitive information about the target endpoint as well as revealing identity information of the producer or consumer of such information.  Similarly, as part of the SACM discovery mechanism, the advertised capabilities (and roles, e.g. SACM components enabled) by the endpoint may be construed as private information. There may be applications as well as business and regulatory practicess that require that aspects of such information be hidden from any parties that do not need to know it. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.2">Data confidentiality can provide some level of privacy but may fall short where unecessary data is still transmitted.  In those cases, filtering requirements at the data model such as OP-005 must be applied to ensure that such data is not disclosed.  <a href="#RFC6973">[RFC6973]</a> provides guidelines for which SACM protocols and information and data models should follow.</p>
